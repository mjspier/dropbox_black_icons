# Dropbox black icon set

Since some versions dropbox ignores the standard icon set in linux and uses its own icons with a white background. This is very ugly on my black status bar.
You can use the install script to copy the icons to the right location.

I modified the icons from: [Dropbox Ubuntu Mono Dark icons](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Dropbox+Ubuntu+Mono+Dark+icons?content=124426)
